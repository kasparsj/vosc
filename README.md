# osc_vj

**This is work in progress!**

osc_vj is a visuals/vjing 2D/3D graphics engine that can be controlled via OSC commands.

It is mainly used within live-coding scenarios sending commands from SuperCollider / TidalCycles.

The engine is built on openFrameworks.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/kasparsj/osc_vj/wiki) for documentation.

See [SuperCollider](SuperCollider) folder for examples.
